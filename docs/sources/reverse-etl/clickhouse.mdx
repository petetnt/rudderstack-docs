## Setting up the ClickHouse source

1. Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com).
2. From the left panel, go to **Directory** > **Sources** > **Reverse ETL**. Then, select **ClickHouse**.
3. Assign a name and click **Continue**.

### Connection credentials

## Mapping warehouse data to destination

After selecting a destination and configuring its connection settings, you can choose how to send the data to it using any one of the following methods:

- <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/common-settings/importing-data-using-tables/">JSON mapping</Link>: This is the default method where you can map a warehouse column to a specific JSON trait key corresponding to a destination field. 

The below image shows the JSON mapping settings:

- <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/features/visual-data-mapper/">Visual Data Mapper (VDM)</Link>: RudderStack supports this method only for <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/features/visual-data-mapper/#supported-destinations">specific destinations</Link>. It offers an intuitive UI to map your warehouse columns to the specific destination fields. 

The below image shows the VDM settings:

<div class="successBlock">
The data sent to the destination is same in both the methods.
